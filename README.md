# Deployment-on-Flask

The dataset contains information about revenue depending on temperature. 
In this project I have built a machine learning model using to predict the Revenue when temperature is entered by the model. 
python library: sklearn (for linearRegression).
The model accuracy is 97.84%. 
Model Evaluation Technique : r2_score from sklearn library.  
I have used pickle library to export the created model into the pickle file. 
For front end I have used HTML.
For Deployment I have used flask.
